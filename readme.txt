This is our cv final project.
To run the code, you can just follow the order to run each cell in each notebook file.
Each file contain different model and approach, we named them with the approaches. The evaluation you can just run each model, and the accuracy will be shown under the cell with output.
Kaggle subbmissions are the file we download to check the performance and upload to the kaggle leader board. We named different Kaggle submission file with their approaches as their names.
